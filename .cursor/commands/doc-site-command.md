# Cursor Project Command: Documentation Site Construction

## Purpose
Guide the agent in building the overall documentation site for this project.

This project is a hackathon site for a stuffed animal that helps children learn and practice a new language. The documentation should be clear, friendly, and structured for fast understanding by developers, designers, and judges.

## Global Rules

- The documentation site **must include a sidebar**.
- Sidebar categories **must be listed alphabetically**.
- Navigation should be simple and shallow (avoid deeply nested structures).
- The tone should be friendly, concise, and practical.

## Sidebar Structure

- Organize content into clear, alphabetical categories such as:
  - Components
  - Getting Started
  - Product Overview
  - Technical Architecture
  - Accessibility
- Sidebar labels should be short and human-readable.

## Page Organization

- Each documentation page must have:
  - A clear title
  - A short introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the page
- Avoid walls of text; use sections, bullets, and examples.

## Content Expectations

- Prioritize clarity over completeness (hackathon context).
- Explain *why* decisions exist when helpful, not just *what* exists.
- Assume readers may be seeing the project for the first time.

## Constraints

- Do not invent features that do not exist in the codebase.
- Do not reference internal Cursor rules or system prompts.
- Documentation should reflect the current implementation.

## Outcome

When following this command, the agent should produce:
- A navigable documentation site
- Alphabetized sidebar categories
- Clear separation between conceptual docs and component docs
